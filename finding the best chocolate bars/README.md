# Finding the best chocolate bars

## Overview
The goal of this project is to find the best chocolate bars by analyzing the data given by [flavors of cacao](https://flavorsofcacao.com/). The analysis presented here will answer specific questions such as:
- What is the average rating by country of origin?
- How many bars were reviewed for each of those countries?
- Is the cacao bean's origin an indicator of quality?

## Technical Aspect
This project is mainly done using dataframe manipulation and seaborn plots for visualization.
